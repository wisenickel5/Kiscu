# Kiscu - Unsupervised Classification of Satellite Images using K-Means

## Getting Started

By virtue of best practices, the virtual environment will not be commited to 
this project. An exact version of Python is not necessary, just ensure that a 
version >= 3.10.0 is being used. The Python community recommends setting up 
PyEnv to manage different versions of Python on your machine, see here: 
https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/

Once the version is set, and the repository has been cloned locally, create a 
new directory called `venv` and `cd` into it. Then run the following command:

```
python -m venv .
```

This will create a new virtual environment. Next, activate it:

For windows (Powershell Session):

```
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

For Mac & Linux:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

Once activated, use pip to install the project's dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
